# Weakly-supervised-models-Vs-Fully-supervised-models-for-Breast-Cancer-detection

This research aims to explore and develop a weakly supervised DL model that detects breast cancer lesions in ultrasound images.

 
 ## 1. Specific Objectives
  (a) To collect and curate both local and open breast ultrasound datasets.
  (b) To develop a weakly supervised DL model that detects breast cancer lesions in breast ultrasound images.
  (c) To evaluate the performance of the developed weakly supervised DL model.
  (d) To evaluate and compare the performance of the developed weakly supervised DL model and a fully supervised DL model.

## 1.1 Significance of the Study

 (a) The present study aims to expand the current understanding of weakly supervised DL for
 medical image analysis, with a particular focus on its application to breast ultrasound images.
 By leveraging large and diverse datasets with weak labels, DL models can be trained more 4 efficiently and effectively, contributing to the ongoing efforts to enhance the accuracy and accessibility of breast cancer detection and diagnosis.
 
 (b) By developing a weakly supervised deep neural network that is capable of accurately diag
nosing breast abnormalities on ultrasound images, this research has the potential to make
 the diagnostic process more efficient and accurate, potentially reducing the workload and
 decision-making burden on radiologists.
